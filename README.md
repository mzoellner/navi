# NAVI
NAVI (Navigational Aids for the Visually Impaired) is a student project at the University of Konstanz which was created during HCI coursework (http://hci.uni-konstanz.de/blog/2011/03/15/navi/?lang=en).

It is a prototype of a navigation system for visually impaired based on the Microsoft Kinect sensor. It gained some attention due to a YouTube video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6QY-eb6NoQ&feature=player_embedded) 
and an appearance at the MIX'11 Keynote (http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/MIX/MIX11/KEY02).

The concepts of NAVI have been described in a poster published at the INTERACT 2011 conference (http://hci.uni-konstanz.de/downloads/interact-navi-2011-cr.pdf), 
which won the Best Poster Award (http://hci.uni-konstanz.de/blog/2011/09/11/best-poster-award-at-interact-2011/?lang=en)

## Future Work

Since NAVI was only a semester project which has finished in February 2011, we won't pursue it further.
